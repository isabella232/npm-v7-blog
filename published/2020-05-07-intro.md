[>> Arborist Deep Dive](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/618653678433435649/npm-v7-series-arborist-deep-dive)

Quite a lot has happened in npm since our [last
update](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/188841555980/updates-to-community-docs-more)
way back in 2019.  We're overdue for a status update on npm v7.

Despite some massive distracting changes (some unfortunate, some [very
fortunate](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/612764866888007680/next-phase-montage)),
development work has been proceeding steadily.

Yesterday, [Edward Thomson](https://github.com/ethomson) presented a
[demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=468tirG434E) of a few of the
features coming in npm v7 at [GitHub
Satellite](https://githubsatellite.com/).  The [Q&A
session](https://github.com/githubevents/satellite2020/discussions/16) was
awesome, and it was clear that a lot of you are excited for this update to
the npm CLI, and have a lot of questions that unfortunately couldn't be
adequately answered in such a short time.

This post started as a brief update on what we've been doing, intended to
go live along with the talk, but it [got
long](https://twitter.com/izs/status/1257878271133278208).  So, instead,
this is the first post, with more to come, where I take you all through
some of the major changes coming in npm v7, the thinking and motivation
behind them, and how they might affect you and your work.

## Vision

npm v7 is based on a handful of technical and user experience principles,
and each post in this series will tie back to one or more of these in some
way.

- **Reduce noise that is not actionable.**  Or, in other words "make npm
  yell at you less".  We've gone through the entire project from the data
  management to the presentation layers, stripping output that doesn't
  provide worthwhile information.
- **Manage your packages for you.**  There are a handful of places in npm
  where v6 and earlier versions sort of throw up their hands and make you
  fix stuff by yourself.  But npm is a package manager!  It shouldn't make
  _you_ manage packages, that's _its_ job!
- **Strict separation of concerns.**  Moving forward, the npm CLI itself is
  becoming strictly the user-interface layer, and we've moved out all
  complex tree management and registry interactions to
  [@npmcli/arborist](http://npm.im/@npmcli/arborist),
  [pacote](http://npm.im/pacote), and the [various `libnpm*`
  modules](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=libnpm).
- **Be as fast as possible while behaving correctly.**  The key to fast
  software is to do as little as possible, including doing as little
  _waiting_ as possible.  From the refactor to use
  [Minipass](http://npm.im/minipass) streams to refactoring out a decade's
  worth of compatibility fixes for long-dead Node.js versions, npm v7 is
  leaner and faster because it's _lazier_.

If we know the right thing to do, let's not yell at you to do it.  Let's
just do it for you, and do it all the way the first time.  That's what `npm
loves you` means.  It means taking care of you and your project like a good
and faithful assistant, only troubling you to get involved when absolutely
necessary.

## Coming Attractions

In the coming npm v7 posts, we'll cover:

- A [deep
  dive](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/618653678433435649/npm-v7-series-arborist-deep-dive)
  on [Arborist](http://npm.im/@npmcli/arborist), the tree management and
  analysis utility that does a lot of heavy lifting in npm v7.
- Updates and impacts from some of the major refactoring that's happened in
  the npm CLI dependency stack over the last year.
- Automatically [installing
  `peerDependencies`](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0025-install-peer-deps.md):
  why, how, and what you might want to be aware of.
- Improvements to the performance, effectiveness, and UI of `npm audit`.
- Updates to the `package-lock.json` format, added handling for `yarn.lock`
  files, and [why we are going to keep using
  `package-lock.json`](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/621733939456933888/npm-v7-series-why-keep-package-lockjson).
- Support for
  [`acceptDependencies`](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0023-acceptDependencies.md)
- Changes to how npm handles install scripts
  ([RFC0021](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0021-reduce-lifecycle-script-environment.md)
  [RFC0022](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0022-quieter-install-scripts.md)
  and
  [RFC0024](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0024-npm-run-traverse-directory-tree.md))
- Fixing the "noisy chokidar/fsevents" problem, and how this is related to
  [npm
  fund](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0017-add-funding-support.md).
- Updates to permission handling while running as `root`.
- Dropping the `--depth` config in [`npm
  update`](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0019-remove-update-depth-option.md)
  and [`npm outdated`](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/133).
- Changes to config options (especially, config options that determine what
  gets installed).
- [Improvements](https://github.com/npm/npm-packlist#interaction-between-packagejson-and-npmignore-rules)
  to the handling of `"files"` in `package.json`.
- [Workspaces](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0026-workspaces.md)
- [Overrides](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/129)
- [Staged publishes](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/92)
- And, presumably, updates about the beta and eventual GA releases, because
  this is going to take a minute :)

## RFC Process

The npm CLI team has been running an open RFC process for the last several
months now, and the impact on our development process has been great.

Usually, writing the code is the easy part.  The hard part is all the
thinking and talking that goes into making sure we're writing code for a
feature that users will benefit from, and that we've explored the edge
cases well enough to be confident we're not overlooking something
important.

If you're interested in getting involved with npm's design process, we want
you to participate!  Building something like this is a team effort, and we
all benefit from getting a broad range of perspectives from our community.

Is there something that you really wish npm would do, or do differently, or
stop doing?  Head over to [npm/rfcs](https://github.com/npm/rfcs) and give
us a proposal.  Obviously the more engaged and thorough you can be, the
more easy it'll be for us to get it done, but every great idea has to start
somewhere, so don't feel like you have to have all the answers before you
begin :)

## Thanks!

If there's something you'd like to see covered around npm v7, you can [post
an issue on the npm/npm-v7-blog
repo](https://github.com/npm/npm-v7-blog/issues).

Stay tuned for more from us, and I hope these posts prove to be fun and
informative!
